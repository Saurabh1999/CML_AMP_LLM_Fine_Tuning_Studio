## Introduction

This document covers an end-to-end example of evaluating a [PEFT Adapter](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/peft) for SQL statement generation within Fine Tuning Studio using MLFlow's LLM evaluation. This covers the entire workflow from within the Studio including importing relevant evaluation datasets, selecting our base model, trained adapter, dataset and prompt that weâ€™d like to use for evaluation.
