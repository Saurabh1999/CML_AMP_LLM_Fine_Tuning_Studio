Since we are not using any migration tool, to keep track of the migrations run on the DB lets maintain all the sql statements used for migrations

Please follow the format :- migrtion_purpose_yyyy_mm_dd_hh_mm.sql    (utc time)
eg axolotl_configuration_insertion_2024_08_26_12_52.sql

This will allow us to retrospect the migrations.
